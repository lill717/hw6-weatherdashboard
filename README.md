# Project name
This is a weather dashboard with a 5 day forecast.

Enter a city you want a weather forecast in the search bar. Doing so will render the current day's forecast including temperature, humidity, wind, and UV index. The next 5 day's forecast will also be displayed. On the left side are saved cities that you previously searched for. Clicking on them will bring up that city's weather again.
