# hw6-weatherdashboard


# Project name
This is a weather dashboard with a 5 day forecast.

 <!-- I work a busy part time job that requires a lot of scheduled appointments. To be time efficient, I needed a daily planner to keep track of all of my important events. I need it colorcoded to tell me which events have passed and which have yet to occur that day. -->
